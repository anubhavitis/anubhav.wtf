        APIs are one of the most significant parts of software development,
        every developer must be well versed with them. I have been working as a
        golang backend engineer for about a year now, have constructed plenty of
        APIs for various projects.

          Application Programming Interface

        , is a set of functions that allows applications to access data and
        interact with external software components, operating systems, or
        microservices.

        In simple words, an API is like a waiter in a restaurant. You don't go
        into a cafe and walk straight into the kitchen to tell the chef what you
        wanna eat. The waiter does that for you, and that's exactly what an API
        is - with the client being you, the customer, and any resource that can
        send data, being the chef.

        Benefits of using APIs
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Security:</span> While using an API,
          client-side and server-side application works independently, and they
          communicate through API, so if anyone tries to hack into the
          client-side app, the server stays unaffected and secured.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Flexibility:</span> APIs allow content
          to be embedded from any site or application more easily. For e.g. an
          API written in GO can be used by Node.js/Django.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Efficiency:</span> When access is
          provided to an API, the content generated can be published
          automatically and is available for every channel. It allows it to be
          shared and distributed more easily.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span className="font-semibold">Innovation:</span> With an API, an
          application layer can be created which can be used to distribute
          information and services to new audiences which can be personalized to
          create custom user experiences.

        REST API

        client-server model where one software program sends a request and the
        other response with some data.

        format, it's a standard format that is easily "understandable" by
        applications and can be handled well in most languages. For e.g. Ruby
        app can easily use JSON response from Java sever.

        REST != HTTP
      </h2>
      <p>
        A lot of people prefer to compare HTTP with REST. REST and HTTP are not
        same.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered
        resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).
        The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined
        operations. The clients and servers exchange representations of
        resources by using a standardized interface and protocol â€“ typically
        HTTP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resources are decoupled from their representation so that their content
        can be accessed in a variety of formats, such as HTML, XML, plain text,
        PDF, JPEG, JSON, and others. Metadata about the resource is available
        and used, for example, to control caching, detect transmission errors,
        negotiate the appropriate representation format, and perform
        authentication or access control. And most importantly, every
        interaction with a resource is stateless.

        API Request & Response

      <p>
        REST API request generally consists of Method, Body(auth and other
        parameters), and Host. Here is a sample request that I have been working
        on recently.
