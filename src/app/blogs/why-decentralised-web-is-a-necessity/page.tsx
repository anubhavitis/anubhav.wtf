      {/* Introduction */}
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        When web first came into existence in 1989, it was decentralised. Anyone
        could publish their content on the internet, and users could access that
        content without any third party services. Communication was easy, secure
        and peer-to-peer.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        However, with the introduction of{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">web 2.0</span> in the early 2000s,
        people began to communicate through centralised services provided by
        several tech giants.

        Centralisation with web 2.0
      </h2>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Current internet architecture is called to be centralised, lead by
        companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. Facebook, for example, now
        boasts <span className="font-semibold">2 Billion</span> monthly active
        users (more than China's whole population). Google is another good
        example; it answers <span className="font-semibold">3.5 Billion</span>{" "}
        requests per day.

        The good:
      </h3>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        These companies became massively dominant in their domain by two
        methods, that have also become the heart and soul of web 2.0
      </p>

      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-6 text-lg">
        <li>Provide excellent services</li>
        <li>Free services for everybody</li>
      </ol>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        You don't have to sift through hundreds of websites to find information;
        instead you can utilise Google's free, fast-searching capabilities. You
        don't have to construct your communication channel or deal with other
        hassles if you want to connect and speak with others; you can do so
        using Facebook's services, which are also free.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The involvement of these third-party services has provided an
        exceptional user experience and most importantly at zero expense.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">The bad:</h3>

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Every internet company has its own data center, where all the user's
        data and their monitored interactions are stored. This infrastructural
        centralisation raises security concerns, by giving clear target points
        for hackers and fraudsters.

        Companies such as Facebook and Google dominate this user attention so

        How does it work?

      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A D-Web removes centralised data hosting services, using instead a
        peer-to-peer infrastructure. Not only will this remove any services from
        a third party that tracks your data, it will also secure and smooth your
        transaction. As a result, no single entity will be able to control or
        manipulate the network of systems on their will.

        D-Web is expected to bring 3 major changes to global internet
