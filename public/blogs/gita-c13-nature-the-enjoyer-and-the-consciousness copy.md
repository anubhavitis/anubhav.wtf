Arjuna asks Krsna to distinguish between some terms that we take for granted. What is nature (prakriti), and the enjoyer? What is the field, and who is the knower of the field? What is knowledge and what is the object of knowledge?

Krsna gives a descriptive response:

- The material universe is the **field**, and one who knows this material universe is called the **knower** of the field.
- The understanding of this body (material universe) and its knower is called **knowledge**.
- Interaction with the **field** is referred to as an activity. Ego, intelligence, senses, desire, happiness, distress etc. are fields of activities and their interactions. As per Vedanta, there are 24 elements of the field:
  - The material universe consists of five elements: Earth, water, fire, air and ether.
  - There are three modes of nature: ego, intelligence and the unmanifested.
  - Five senses to acquire knowledge: eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin.
  - Five working senses: voice, legs, hands, anus and genitals.
  - And mind, above and within all senses.
  - Five sense objects: smell, taste, form, touch and sound.
- Humility, pridelessness, simplicity, renunciation of objects and sense desires, freedom from entanglement with children, wife, home and the rest, absence of ego, unalloyed devotion to me, and philosophical search for the Absolute Truth etc. are **Knowledge**, and everything else is **Ignorance**.
- The supreme truth exists outside and inside of all living beings, the moving and non-moving. Although far, far away, the Supreme is closest to all. The supreme truth is the only thing that is **Knowable**.
- All this Knowledge, Knowable, Field and Field of activities can only be understood by a true devotee of Krsna.

Krsna explains the cause and effects of nature and living beings:

- **Nature** is the cause of all material cause and effects. **Living beings** are the cause of suffering and enjoyments.
- Living entities in material nature follow ways of life driven by one of the modes of nature (next chapter). Thus their manifestation is the cause of their next life.
- There are people who meditate, and people who learn to cultivate knowledge, and people who work without fruitive desires, and people who are devotional. These people detach from the modes of nature and move towards the path of liberation.
- Whatever you see in existence, both moving and non-moving, is a combination of the knower and field of activities. The Super-soul exists in all, and it does nothing. It just sees everything.
