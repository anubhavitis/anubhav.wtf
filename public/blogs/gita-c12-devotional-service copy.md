As discussed before, there are several ways to reach Krsna. Mainly by being personalists (accepting God in a personal form and attributes, bhakti-yoga) or impersonalists (accepting God as infinity, jnana-yoga).

Arjuna enquires which of the two paths are better, and which one Krsna likes. Krsna answers:

- Those who fix their mind on my personal form with transcendental faith are perfect for me and those who surrender to the unmanifested by controlling their senses and are equipoised to everyone in every situation, at last achieve me.
- For impersonalists, the path is very challenging. Because attachment is troublesome for the embodied.

Krsna now puts forth different ways to reach him from most difficult to easiest one. He says:

- Fix your mind upon me, and engage all your intelligence in me. Jnana-Yoga. Thus you'll always live in me.
- If you cannot fix your mind upon me, then follow devotional services. Bhakti-Yoga. And you'll attain me.
- If you cannot follow principles of Bhakti Yoga, then devote all your work to me.
- If you are unable to work in my consciousness then give up all the results of your work and be equipoised.
- If you cannot practice that, then engage yourself in cultivating knowledge. It'll help you to develop desire for me. However, better than knowledge is meditation, and better than meditation is renunciation of fruits.

At last Krsna concludes:

- Those who are still in all situations, are beyond ego and understand that they are just actors in this universe. Those who surrender their life to the infinity and are always kind to both friends and enemies. Those who always think of me. Are the ones who attain me because they are very dear to me.
