## What’s Happening

Launched on November 2018, [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/), quickly became the leading decentralized exchange (DEX). However with time it faced declining dominance due to high Ethereum gas fees. These elevated costs drove users toward cheaper alternatives like [Solana](https://solana.com/) and [BNB Chain](https://www.bnbchain.org/en), especially during the memecoin trading frenzy. As a result, Uniswap needed a strategy to win back users and liquidity by making its ecosystem more attractive, affordable, and developer-friendly.

## Unichain’s Liquidity Incentive Program

To address these challenges, Uniswap launched [Unichain](https://www.unichain.org/), an Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain, on February-2025. To jumpstart adoption, Uniswap introduced a $45 million liquidity incentive program. Here’s how it works:

### Liquidity Incentives

Users who provide liquidity by depositing tokens into Unichain and Uniswap V4, are rewarded. Making it more profitable to trade and supply assets on the new chain.

### Comprehensive Growth Plan

This incentive program is part of a broader $165 million initiative by the Uniswap Foundation, including:

- $95.4 million in grants for developers, core contributors, and validators
- $25.1 million for team expansion and governance tooling

The primary goal is to supercharge growth, attract developers, and establish Unichain as a leading hub for DeFi activity.

## Outcome

The results have been immediate and dramatic. Within a month, active addresses on Unichain surged by 21,713%, reaching 236,452. While this number is still small compared to Solana (112 million), Base (19.7 million), and Ethereum (7.3 million), it’s a significant leap for a chain that’s only a month old. Uniswap also maintains a substantial $3.69 billion in total value locked (TVL), underlining its ongoing relevance in the DeFi space.

## What future looks like?

In the short term, Unichain is likely to see continued growth in users and liquidity as more participants seek to benefit from the incentive program. The initiative has already passed a temperature check vote with 82.6% support and is awaiting a formal governance vote, making its implementation likely.

Looking further ahead, if these incentives succeed, Unichain could emerge as a major Layer 2 hub, reclaiming users and developers from rival chains. The ultimate challenge will be sustaining this growth once the incentives taper off. If Unichain can deliver a superior user and developer experience beyond the incentive period, Uniswap may well regain its position at the forefront of decentralized finance.
