What an amazing blend of science and spirituality. Never have I ever read a scientist talking about god's will in the roots of their work. There were moments which got me spirited, and there were moments which left me in tears.

What a wholesome experience it was to read this book. Unarguably one of the best memoirs I have read till now. Which I am sure I'll skim often.

Some of my favourite moments from book:

_A good student could learn more from a bad teacher than a poor student from even a skilled teacher._

_To succeed in life and achieve results, you must understand and master three mighty forces: Desire, Belief and Expectation_

_The best performances are accomplished when you are relaxed and free of doubt._

_Don't make rocketry your profession, your livelihood; make it your religion, your mission._

_Total commitment is a crucial quality for those who want to reach the very top of their profession._

_To live only for some unknown future is superstitious. It is like climbing a mountain to reach the peak without experiencing its sides. The sides of the mountain sustain life, not the peak. This is where things grow, experience is gained, and technologies are mastered. The importance of the peak lies only in the fact that it defines the sides. So I went on towards the top but always experiencing the sides._

_the sweetness we taste in a piece of sugar is neither a property of the sugar nor a property of ourselves. We are producing the experience of sweetness in the process of interacting with the sugar_

_know where you are going. The great thing in the world is not knowing so much as in what direction we are moving_

_we decided to achieve something that was way beyond our collective national capability_

_through loyalty to a friend, one can be easily led into doing something that is not in the best interest of the organization. Perhaps the main motive behind my isolation was my desire to escape from the demands of relationships, which I consider very difficult in comparison of making rockets_

_what you imagine is what will transpire. What you believe is what you will achieve_

_be more dedicated to making solid achievements than in running after swift but synthetic happiness_

_when you work as a project team, you need to develop a complex view of the success criteria. There are multiple and often conflicting sets of expectations that exist about a team's performance_

_the youth of today must unlearn this self-defeating way of life, the culture of working only for material possessions and rewards must be discarded._

The story of Sir Kalam is filled with big failures and even bigger achievements. He kept is head high in all of those moments and trusted god to create ways for him. He never aimed to become rocket scientist, missile scientist, or even the president of the country. In doing so, he has gone through heart breaking failures and disappointments. And still, he never complained about it and kept doing what he could for betterment of humanity.

Throughout his story, Kalam sir talked lot of people management. He believed that to achieve big goals, you need right people to work with you. He had spent lot of time understanding people he worked with and making sure everyone gets enough space to express and communicate. Perhaps these qualities and focus on execution is what made him Missile Man of Inda.
