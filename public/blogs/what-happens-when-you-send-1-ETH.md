If you're someone non-technical into crypto and often find all this Web3 stuff confusing, here’s something that can get you started.

If you're a technical person and want to dive deep into what actually happens, wait a bit, I’ll be sharing a tech-focused article soon.

For now, lets's start with basic question:

**what happens when I send 1ETH?**
(Apart from the fact that I lose ~$3k)

### TL;DR

In the global Ethereum database, 1 ETH is subtracted from my account and added to the receiver’s account. A small transaction fee, called a **gas fee** is also involved. And this action is **practically irreversible**.

But of course, I already know that. So let’s go a little (or a lot) deeper.

## I have 10 ETH in my Ethereum account

(No, I don’t. But let’s say I do.)

An Ethereum account is simply an address in the global Ethereum [ledger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger). It stores a lot of information, one of which is how many tokens that address holds.

That’s it. Me having 10 ETH just means the global Ethereum ledger says that my account address holds 10 units of the ETH token. No physical entity is involved here.

## I want to send 1 ETH to my friend Pranay

![Transaction Example](/images/eth-node-example.png)

First, I need to know Pranay’s account address on the global ledger. Then all I need to do is update the ledger like this:

```
0xab1e....12er (Anubhav) : -1 ETH
0xyg9q....8j0d (Pranay): +1 ETH
```

## Why do I need Pranay’s address?

Privacy is a fundamental principle of Ethereum. The **network doesn’t know me, nor does it try to**. All it knows is that there are addresses, and some data associated with each address.

So, to send 1 ETH to Pranay, I need his address on the ledger to tell the network where to send it.

But wait, does that mean...

## Can I update values in anyone’s address?

No, **I cannot**. I mean, **no individual can**.

However, a **network of computers** can. Sounds confusing, right? Let’s break that down.

## What is the Ethereum global ledger?

Unlike traditional banks, where a single ledger is securely guarded inside the bank’s walls, Ethereum’s global ledger is **distributed across a network of computers**, called as **nodes**.

Each node holds a small (tiny) piece of the ledger, along with a reference to the state of the complete ledger.

![Ledger Example](/images/eth-ledger-example.png)

Think of the global ledger as a huge puzzle, every node has a piece of it and a picture of what the complete puzzle looks like.

## So, how do I update my values in the global ledger?

I can’t directly change it, but, **I can ask the network** to make a change for me. In our case, the change is simple:

```
0xab1e....12er (Me) : -1 ETH
0xyg9q....8j0d (Pranay): +1 ETH
```

Here, both my address and Pranay’s address are being updated.

## Does that mean the network will do anything I ask it to?

Actually, it’s the opposite.  
**I can only do what the network allows me to do.**

The Ethereum network gives me a set of functions I can perform on the chain, such as:

`transfer(address to, uint tokens)`, `approve(address spender, uint tokens)`, `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens)`, `balanceOf(address tokenOwner)`, etc.

In this case, I’ll use the `transfer` function, and the network will update the ledger as follows:

```
0xab1e....12er (Me) : -1 ETH
0xyg9q....8j0d (Pranay): +1 ETH
```

## How do I make a transfer request to the network?

That’s actually pretty straightforward. Since the ledger is distributed across a **network** of nodes, I can simply communicate with one node (a computer) to make my transfer request. The node will then share the request with the rest of the network.

![Node Example](/images/eth-transaction-example.png)

Simple, right?  
Well, not exactly, before the network accepts my request, **someone needs to validate it**. That’s where validators come in.

## Why do we need a validator?

Before sending a transaction to the Ethereum chain, the network needs to ensure it’s legitimate and secure.

### I have to sign the message

Since the network doesn’t know who I am, it needs a way to verify that I’m the rightful owner of the account sending the ETH. That’s where **signatures** come into play.

![Signature Example](/images/eth-signature-example.png)

This digital signature is like my consent/proof that I approve sending 1 ETH from my account to Pranay’s account. It’s unique and can only be generated by me using my private key.  
That way, the validator knows the transaction is authentic.

Validators also check other things, like whether I even have 1 ETH to send, and if the receiver’s address is valid. Let’s assume my transaction passes all checks and is valid.

## Why do validators do this?

Simple. for money.

Every transaction includes a **gas fee**, which incentivizes validators to process and secure transactions.

This process is known as **mining**. So when people say they’re “mining crypto,” it simply means they’ve set up machines to validate transactions on a blockchain.

## Why do I trust validators not to cheat?

Because every validator has to **stake** a minimum of [32 ETH](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) to participate. This stake acts as a security deposit.

If a validator misbehaves, or even appears to, their staked ETH is **slashed**, and they’re kicked out of the network.

This ensures high security for every Ethereum transaction. Once a validator approves my transaction, it’s sent on-chain and executed by an available node.

## Tada 🎉

My transaction is now live on the chain, and I’m 1 ETH poorer :/

The key takeaway here is that this entire process is **irreversible**. Once a transaction is processed and added to the blockchain, it **can never be undone**.

The only way I’d get my ETH back is if Pranay decides to send it back to me.
