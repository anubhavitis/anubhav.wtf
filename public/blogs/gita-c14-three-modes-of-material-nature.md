This material universe is the source of birth of all living entities, and the Supreme is the seed-giving father of all species of life. This combination of living and non-living things is created by the Supreme.

Krsna extends his explanation about the material universe and living entities in this universe. This material universe consists of three modes:

- **Goodness**: The mode of being pure and sinless is illuminating. Those conditioned in this mode are bound to be happy and knowledgeable.
- **Passion**: The mode of desires and longing. Those conditioned in this mode are bound to attachments and fruitive actions.
- **Ignorance**: The mode of evil and darkness. Those conditioned in this mode are bound to madness, indolence and foolishness.

A living entity born in this material universe is bound by these modes. In each living entity, all these modes compete for supremacy.

These interactions with modes determine the cause and effect of a living entity. If one leaves the body with supremacy in:

- **Goodness mode**: they attain purer and higher forms of afterlife as great sages.
- **Passion mode**: they attain earthly afterlife engaged with fruitive activities.
- **Ignorance mode**: they attain life lower than human (among 8 million species).

When one understands and sees that each act of a living entity in the material universe is driven by these modes, they develop knowledge of the Supreme. And if they detach from these modes, they become free from the cycle of birth and death.

Arjuna enquires: how can one recognize someone who is detached from these modes? What is their behavior and attributes? How did they transcend in the first place?

- The one who is not affected by different states of the material universe
- The one who understands every act is driven by modes of nature
- The one who looks upon a lump of earth, stone and gold with an equal eye
- The one who is steady and situated equally in praise and blame, honor and dishonor
- The one who treats alike friends, enemies and strangers
- The one who renounces all desires

These are the attributes of a person who has transcended from all modes of nature to the level of the universe itself. And the Supreme is the basis of this universe which is imperishable, immortal and eternal.
