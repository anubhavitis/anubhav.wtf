This chapter starts with Arjuna asking explanation on what is Brahman, what is self, what are material manifestations, what is Karma, what are demigods, who is lord of sacrifice and how he lives inside our body, how can one engage in devotional services and how can one know you at the time of the death?

Lord answers:

- **Brahman**: The indestructible transcendental entity
- **Self**: The eternal nature of the Brahman
- **Karma**: Action responsible for development of material bodies, also referred as fruitive activities
- **Material Manifestation**: The physical nature, which is constantly changing.
- **Adhidaiva**: The universal form of supreme that includes all the demigods
- **Lord of Sacrifice**: The supreme lord as supreme soul in every living being.

- Supreme lord is sitting in hearts of all being and gives us free will and witnesses our activities.
- Whatever state of mind one has at the time of death, they attain that body in the next life. Anyone who is in constant state of devotion, quits their body remembering Krsna and they attain supreme nature.
- One who always remembers Krsna without deviation can easily obtain him. His constant engagement is called **devotional service**.

Lord explains more about material universe

- Cycle of ages(yuga):
  - **Satya**: Age of spirituality and devotions with no ignorance or vice. Timeline 1,728,000 years.
  - **Treta**: Age where vice is introduces. Timeline 1,296,000 years.
  - **Dvapara**: Age where spirituality declines significantly and vice grows everywhere. Timeline 864,000 years
  - **Kali**: Age where vice grows over spirituality and the life is annihilated at the end of this yuga. Timeline 432,000 years.
- One Brahman day includes thousands cycles of ages. Same duration of night. One Brahma lives for 100 such years which is 311 trillion and 40 billion earth years.
- what lord is explaining, whole material universe goes through these cycle of birth and annihilation, only supreme is constant which has no birth, no age, and no death.

Lord later explains how after death of yogi, they may or maynot come back:

- There are some holy time to die, when their is strong influence of demigods (sun, moon etc) as per their positioning. Anyone leaving their body can also attain supreme.
- Yogis who attain this knowledge decide their time to leave material body in order to attain supreme. They temporarily attain supreme because they aren't completely rid of their karma and thus return to material nature as per their karma.
- A true devotee who surrenders his life to Krsna never returns back, irrespective of their time of death. Because they are trully detached from the material universe and fruitive activites.
