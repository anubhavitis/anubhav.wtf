Krsna explains the knowlege of absolute, once this is known, nothing else is left to be known.

- There are two kinds of divine's energy in this universe
	- Material Energy (Inferior Energy)
	- Spiritual Energy (Superior Energy)
- All the creation have these two energies as source. Either its material or spiritual. And Lord is in all of them. There is no origin for him or the dissolution.
- Spiritual Energy is the energy that comprises of all living entities. Animals, Plans, Birds etc.
- Material Energy constitutes of eight elements: Earth, Fire, Water, Air, Space(Ether), Mind, Intelligence, and Ego. These material energy works with manifestations of spiritual energy.
- taste of water, or heat of the sun, strength of the strong, sex life, intelligent life, etc. Lord is in all of them.
- Spiritual energies tend to forget about the supreme energies by getting deluded in the material energy. Though the supreme is above all, and inexhaustible.
- Only way to know this absolute truth is through complete surrender to the lord. One can never know this truth as long as they are participating with material energies for that works with manifestations of spiritual energies.
- Four kinds of people live pious life
	- The distressed: people who are unhappy in life
	- The desirer: people who have material desires (power, wealth, family, sex etc)
	- The inquisitive: people who are curious
	- The explorer: people who are searching for the absolute truth
- Among above four, one with pure devotion and surrender to god is the one who learns this truth. Following devotion for fruititive actions leads to nothing. 

Lord continues to explain demigods of material world
- supreme lives within heart of all the beings, and gives them independence to make their choices. 
- If one devotes to demigods (material gods) like Laxmi for wealth or Sarawati for Education. With true devotion, lord provides these temporary fruits of materials. 
- Anyone can follow the vedic texts to devote these demigods and lord will fullfill their manifestations. 
- supreme is above all demigods. above all materials. above all ego, goodness and passion. Only less intelligent people who are deluded with materials devote to demigods.
