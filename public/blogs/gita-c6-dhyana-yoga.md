from: [Bhagavad-Gita As It Is](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/991544.Bhagavad_Gita_As_It_Is)

In this chapter, supreme lord krsna explained;

- There is a ladder to self realization and this ladder starts with renunciation of sensual pleasures.
- Your mind is the best friend of the soul and one who detaches from the sensual pleasures gets to befriend his mind and soul.
- Meditation is the way to control your restless mind which is always busy with external world. Breathe by breathe you bring your mind back to self.
- Keep your back, neck and head erect, focus your eyes on your nostrils. And focus your mind on one singular point. Be it breathe, chants, shape, etc.
- This life of yogi should also be detached from fruititive work. Meditating with aim to benefit self-realization is waste of time. It should always be directed with true love of god.

Arjuna asks Lord: The summarized yoga appears so impractical and unendurable to me. Our mind is so restless that it is easier to control the wind than the mind. If one steps towards self realization and fails, then they would fail both in spiritual and physical realm. How to deal with these failures?

Supreme responds:

- A yogi walks on the spiritual path for the transcendental love, not for any fruititive activities.
- And, even some steps to direction of lord, is better than none.
- If a yogi fails to self realization this life, then their spiritual alignment is passed on to next life. They are born with transcendental bliss and continue their spiritual journey in next life.
- You are eternal, your body is temporary. If you work with krsna consciousness, you will attain connection with supreme. If not in this life, then surely in several life times.
