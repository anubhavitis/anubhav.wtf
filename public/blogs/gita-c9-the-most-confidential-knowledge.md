This chapter was all about Krishna explaining the the supreme knowledge. Something which is above all to be known. And it goes like:

- I am everywhere, I am everything, all the materials are part of me, though I don't live in them.
- I create this material universe, and I annihilate it at the end. Yet, I am away from these activities. Yet I am above all.
- Those who read vedas they devote to demigods for material desires, which they will achieve on true devotion. But they forget that I am god of gods. I am the fire, the sacrifice, the butter and the prayer.
- I am the neutral, with no bias. Surrender every breathe of yours into me. Because I am that ever was and ever will be. Even the most abominable actions are ignored in your karma if they are devoted to me.
- I am the right, and I am the wrong.
- Anyone who truly devotes me, attains me. Others are always stuck in this material world with their material desires.
