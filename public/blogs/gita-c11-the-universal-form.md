Arjuna requests to see supreme's universal transcedental form. Arjuna has already surrendered to him. Krsna says:

- no knowledge from veda, sacrifices, or charity can lead one to my universal form.
- I am giving you divine eyes to see whatever you want to see, because I am the beginning and the end and beyond.

Since supreme cannot be witnessed by mere human eyes, Arjuna is blessed with divine eyes to see the opulence. Arjuna was bewildered. He say infinite eyes, and infinite face with infinite hands and infinite legs. He saw demigods and sages bowing to the lord. The raidiance of the view was equal to thousand suns.

Arjuna gets scared of this universal form. He saw so many scary versions of Krsna and everyone from battlefield getting absorbed into Krsna's mouth. He bows to the lord and ask for forgiveness for his past mistakes where he treated Krsna as a human and a friend. And Krsna says

- As you can see the outcome of everyone in this field is decided. I am here to destroy them all.
- So don't get dishearted of the outcome, pick your weapon and fullfill your duty.
- It is I whoose manifestatios will conclude the war.
