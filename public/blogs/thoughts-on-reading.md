Lately I've been thinking, reading might be my most productive form of procrastination.

---

Back in 2014, my maths tutor was showing me how [Euclidian Geometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry) often fails in a three-dimensional world. I didn't get much, but I was curious, so he provided me a photocopy of a few pages from the [book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33426.Hyperspace) he was reading. Later in the night, I went through them, and I was amazed.

Little did he know, he was incepting an idea bigger than science and mathematics. he showed me that there is a world beyond academic books which is more challenging and fascinating.

I wasn't very good in studies, so papa didn't entertain my interest in non-academic books. So I started printing that book, chapter by chapter. And half-year later, I finished my first book.

### reading keeps me humble

In a way, reading books is about fascinating black symbols over white background. And somehow we end up making genuine sense out of it. It's beautiful and funny at the same time.

There are numerous reasons one should read a book, my fav is that it makes me calm and humble. Every fiction I read teleports me to another world, every biography makes me feel the challenges everyone goes through, every philosophy read makes me question my entire beliefs and thinking.

There is so much hard work that is poured into writing a decent book, and all of that ambition and energy becomes part of that book. Spending time with that energy itself has precious ripples in our life. That's the main reason I learned to buy physical books over digital copies. (also books smell is intoxicating, iykyk)

### so far

I have read over 60 books [that I can recall](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/138347961-anubhav-singhal?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read). Started from unavoidable swirl of self-help books, later exploring fictions, biographies, memoirs, philosophies, spirituality, religion, tech, etc.

First I read what I like, now I like whatever I read. Just like that.

### choosing right books

Reading has become brag-worthy material now. I often see people who say that they like to read but never actually read. Or people who keep on talking about various productivity hacks from different books and call themselves productivity experts, etc.

Simply put, the internet has become too noisy, so I have learned to specifically ignore the books that everyone talks about.

I just like to often visit bookstores, and actively follow my reader friends' collections. This gives me enough exposure to various kinds of good books, and next I leave things to the universe, so that the right book finds me when I need it most.

In 2021, I stumbled upon the book [Life After Google](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32073021-life-after-google) and I decided to go bullish into blockchain technology.

In 2023, I found [The Essentials of Hinduism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63245490-the-essentials-of-hinduism) at my cousin sister's home, and learned how most people around me have misunderstood our religion.

In 2024, I discovered [Be Here Now](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41580312-be-here-now), and I started my course around spirituality.

I often say (jokingly) that I don't have a personality, I am just a weird collection of the books I have read and the music I have listened to.

### but

Recently, I have discovered that I have also been using my books as a shield to hide behind the action.

In all the lust for learning, productivity, or even being intellectually fashionable, we have grown to settle on an understanding that reading books is better than mindlessly scrolling social media or going to parties, etc. Technically reading is better, but at the end, it is also a form of content consumption dressed as productivity.

### we are creators

The biggest thing that sets humans apart from all the species is that we have the right combination of intellectual and physical capabilities to learn and create things.

We created music, stories, societies, industries, and our latest creation is Artificial Intelligence.

Humans thrive when they create, and to be a good creator, we often need to consume the right information. This is where consumption comes into the picture.

I have often spent hours reading books early morning, which I believe could have been shared with the gym or maybe going on a walk with my parents. I could have shipped my side projects significantly earlier if only I had balanced my time with reading.

And I guess I am not alone in this, this is true more broadly.

### read and act

The only purpose of **consumption** should be **creation**. Else it's not useful. It doesn't help you or your friends, or society.

We should read, and we should read more often. And we should act more. That's what books are meant for, to be your guide in your hard times, when a human is not around to help you. They are our best friends and our best teachers.

We should work hard enough to earn our next book.
