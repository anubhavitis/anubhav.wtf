This chapter was about Krsna describing how limitless his manifestations are.

- Mere human can try to understand him, but they can't.
- Krsna is the source of all moving and non-moving objects.
- Krsna is the source of all emotions we feel.
- Krsna is the source of all goods and evil.
- Krsna is source of all gods and demigods
- .... Krsna explained this in many examples.

Krsna says:

- You don't require this knowledge at the first pace.
- A human can never understand his opulence.
- Surrender every moment, every breathe to Krsna. And Krsna will create ways for true devotee to reach to him.
